# Corda Kubernetes Deployment Chart

This directory contains two Helm charts, one for initial registration of a Corda Node and one for deploying the Corda Node along with optional Corda Firewall to a Kubernetes cluster.

---

## Prerequisites

- Corda Enterprise binaries available in ``docker-images/bin`` folder as per previous steps in ``corda-kubernetes-deployment``
- Kubernetes cluster set up with access to a Docker Container Registry
- Docker Container Registry
- StorageClass linked to correctly set up Cloud storage
- Database cluster with JDBC connection string
- kubectl is used to manage Kubernetes cluster (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- Helm (https://helm.sh/)

---

## Configuration

All the values listed in `values.yaml` can be modified to customise the deployment of the Corda Node.
Please pay attention to correct spelling of the content of each variable.

## Initial registration

The one time registration of a Corda Node to a Corda Network has to be performed before deploying the Nodes to the Kubernetes cluster. 
This can be done by executing the script ``initial_registration/initial_registration.sh`` 

NOTE! Make sure you have completed ALL prerequisites (also in corda-kubernetes-deployment) and filled in ``values.yaml`` entirely

## Installation

Executing ``helm_compile.sh`` will compile the Helm charts into Kubernetes templates and apply them directly to the Kubernetes cluster.

This is the recommended mode of operation. (you may use ``delete-all.sh`` to clean out the cluster for a fresh deploy)

## Manual Installation

First we have to create a namespace for this installation, if installing multiple nodes, the namespace should be customized per installation (and configured in ``values.yaml`` as well).

    kubectl create namespace corda

Next we generate the Kubernetes templates that we will be deploying to the Kubernetes Cluster.

    helm template . --name corda --namespace corda --output-dir output

Next we deploy the template to the cluster.

    kubectl apply -f output --namespace=corda

This step can be repeated if you change any of the parameters in the template.
